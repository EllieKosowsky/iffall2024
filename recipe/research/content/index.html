            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Challah is a special bread eaten every Friday night and Saturday to celebrate the weekly Jewish holiday of Sabbath. My mom has been baking homemade challah for as long as I can remember, and there’s nothing more comforting and delicious than starting our meals with a warm, fresh slice.
            I am so lucky that she takes the time every week to make a fresh batch, so I wanted to share the recipe with you guys! This recipe is a culmination of different recipes that my mom has tweaked and perfected over the years.</p>

                    <li>Question: How long does it take make the Challah beginning to end?</li>
                    <p class="answer">Answer: While it doesn't take so long to throw the ingredients together, the bread
                        machine takes 1.5 hours and needs 4-6 hours to rise after. Overall, I would say thr process takes 8 hours
                        with only about an hour being active cooking/cleaning.

            <h2>Other Websites:</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla:</a> Tesla’s website is super sleek and modern, which is on theme with their cars. The website features clean lines, simple text, and very cool, aesthetic photos of their products. It’s really easy to navigate which is important for a website as I want mine to be smooth to navigate as well.</p>

                <br>

                <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/today/">Pintrest:</a> Pinterest is a perfect example of being able to show a lot of content without overwhelming a user. The website uses a grid layout when browsing which I could use as insparation when organizing a website. I also realy like how the website uses rounded boxes which adds dimension to the page and is more playful than a normal rectangul.</p>
                <br>

                <p><a href="https://store.google.com/?pli=1&hl=en-US">Google Store:</a> Goole Store is super sleek and similiar to Apple's webstie which I really like.
                The design is more minimalist with very simple and clear navigation. The user experience is great because of the intiuative filters which is something I would want my recipe website to have.</p>
