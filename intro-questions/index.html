            <li>Name: Ellie Kosowsky, Major: Computer Science, Year: Senior</li>
            <li>I decided to add an HCI minor because I was interested in learning more about UX/UI. When looking through the electives this class seemed like the perfect chance to sharpen my skills when designing interactive solutions for communication challenges.</li>
            <li>I don’t have much experience with HTML/CSS/JS, but I am currently enrolled in Web Dev so I will be getting a lot of exposure this semester.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn how to create more engaging and intuitive user experiences, which would mean effectively using HTML and CSS to enhance functionality and aesthetics.</li>
            <li>When designing for a screen you need to take into account that you can adjust the size of a screen as opposed to a piece of paper which is a fixed size.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's Website</a> Apple’s website exemplifies effective design through its minimalist aesthetic and intuitive navigation. There is consistent use of typography and spacing which makes the user experience seamless.</li>
            <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify's Website</a>: Spotify’s website effectively communicates what it offers by focusing on clear navigation and engaging visuals. The content is well organized making it very user friendly.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon's Website</a>: Amazon’s website works well because of its efficient search functionality and the user-friendly shopping experience.</li>
